    A simple user journey of using the API resources. 
    
    * The person gifting (gifter) the cash creates a cash-gift by means of _/cashGiftCreation_, and recieves a link representing the gift. There-upon the gifter can share this link (via mail, sms, QrCode) to the intended recipient of the gift.<br>
    * The recipient can view the details of the cash-gift using _/cashGiftDetails_ and can redeem the gift by furnishing one's bank account in request towards _/cashGiftRedemption_.<br>
